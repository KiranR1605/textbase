              "[\" What will bring more value in the long run for a child? It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person. And I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this sort of psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogging a life from runs of marathon. You have to sort of ease into it and train and get better. And so the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. Right? So I think you can start by asking some questions like to this person, how do you plan? Retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year. Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Simple wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in the stock market. Now if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to nickmory.com. That's MUR-A-Y. Because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a, not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I've ever read that one yet. It sounds like what your time has all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put. Sure, it's your, it's how much risk you need to take how much you want to take and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person would decad to head of them. Need to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year. I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $120,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at Realty Ritold's wife, man, event Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. guilty as charged. So I want to start single mail is in the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up and that's fantastic given where he isn't life. So his question, what are you doing with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers because in recent years you talked me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a-favorite now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule the 7, gross to $12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to $24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this tax bear, this single mail is doing this. Right. He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednauseum, called a Backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single mail is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if you wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in 6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth. There is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the Backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS Chief Council signed off on this about two or three years ago in a conference before then. There was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation. And the top attorney of the IRS comes out and says, this is cool. That's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, to the other that, oh sorry, go ahead back. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self. Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going to be go by possibly. Yep. Yep. This was part of the House Wains and Means proposal committee budget that came out in September. And yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political so popper going on with budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools for a 1K Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told that owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this so holds true? If so is real estate investing still viable option these days with loaded home prices. And then they go and give us the context of there. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. These these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time. Like those are the pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for rental property and your property manager now. And especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is they're not huge pools of capital coming in here. That weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. Like I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners write. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on, broadly in the market, but the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with, that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say 10 years or more. We all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000 right and he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was 100x. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The quality had to be replaced taxes are our, Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist. And if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? I owe them a first month rent that that choose into my net operating profit the year and year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again, eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their, their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers not picking up the phone, and there's water pouring out all over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car, at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost and less about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah, all right. One more bonus question for you guys, and I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They haven't been communicated with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in. That's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car is getting too much gaspin. So yeah, so in May, they told us. We're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees and bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. We'll go buy. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life more accurately. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house. Said they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look gorgeous. Beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 with the trees here. No. The kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feed? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price? There's a cap ratio on the trees based on the number of leaves. I think I do I just suck it up here. These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. I would go straight biblical. You go I for two. You take his. That's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You go fix people's toilets in middle the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I'm not going to do it. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000. It's a depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. I think I got a steel. Then you can sell them as lumber. That's going to save them. The solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me new lead isn't. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday, and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week. Thank you.\",\n",
              " \" What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon? A one-time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunks over the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice. Or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year, the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the market's work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the market. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it, as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital and time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Cussmer's Yats. It's one of the best title books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book I've ever read. It has written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage. I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl, what it is like to be a wife and a mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by the words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they used to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person. And I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this sort of psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogging a life from runs of marathon. You have to sort of ease into it and train and get better. And so the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. Right?

Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers because in recent years you talked me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a-favorite now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule the 7, gross to $12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to $24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this tax bear, this single mail is doing this. Right. He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednauseum, called a Backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single mail is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if you wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in 6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth. There is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the Backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS Chief Council signed off on this about two or three years ago in a conference before then. There was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation. And the top attorney of the IRS comes out and says, this is cool. That's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, to the other that, oh sorry, go ahead back. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self. Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going to be go by possibly. Yep. Yep. This was part of the House Wains and Means proposal committee budget that came out in September. And yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political so popper going on with budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools for a 1K Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told that owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this so holds true? If so is real estate investing still viable option these days with loaded home prices. And then they go and give us the context of there. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. These these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time. Like those are the pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for rental property and your property manager now. And especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is they're not huge pools of capital coming in here. That weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. Like I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners write. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on, broadly in the market, but the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with, that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say 10 years or more. We all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000 right and he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was 100x. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The quality had to be replaced taxes are our, Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist. And if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? I owe them a first month rent that that choose into my net operating profit the year and year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again, eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their, their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers not picking up the phone, and there's water pouring out all over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car, at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost and less about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah, all right. One more bonus question for you guys, and I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They haven't been communicated with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in. That's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car is getting too much gaspin. So yeah, so in May, they told us. We're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees and bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. We'll go buy. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life more accurately. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house. Said they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look gorgeous. Beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 with the trees here. No. The kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feed? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price? There's a cap ratio on the trees based on the number of leaves. I think I do I just suck it up here. These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. I would go straight biblical. You go I for two. You take his. That's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You go fix people's toilets in middle the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I'm not going to do it. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000. It's a depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. I think I got a steel. Then you can sell them as lumber. That's going to save them. The solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me new lead isn't. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday, and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week. Thank you.\",\n",
              " \" How does the fed raising interest rates fights off inflation? We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come to play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now real quick on some of the format of the show before we get started here, we get a wider range of questions. Everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto, to saving retirement. Everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing our podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here. Just link it out there, my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey everyone, we received a matchaver. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it. It's cool to see so many of you already are already showing up there. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one-time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunks over the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice. Or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year, the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the market's work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the market. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it, as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital and time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Cussmer's Yats. It's one of the best title books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book I've ever read. It has written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage. I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl, what it is like to be a wife and a mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by the words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they used to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person. And I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this sort of psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogging a life from runs of marathon. You have to sort of ease into it and train and get better. And so the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. Right? So I think you can start by asking some questions like to this person, how do you plan? Retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year. Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Simple wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in the stock market. Now if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to nickmory.com. That's MUR-A-Y. Because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a, not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I've ever read that one yet. It sounds like what your time has all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put. Sure, it's your, it's how much risk you need to take how much you want to take and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person would decad to head of them. Need to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year. I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $120,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at Realty Ritold's wife, man, event Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. guilty as charged. So I want to start single mail is in the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up and that's fantastic given where he isn't life. So his question, what are you doing with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified.

He printed it on his own and Nick is a, not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I've ever read that one yet. It sounds like what your time has all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put. Sure, it's your, it's how much risk you need to take how much you want to take and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person would decad to head of them. Need to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year. I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $120,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at Realty Ritold's wife, man, event Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. guilty as charged. So I want to start single mail is in the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up and that's fantastic given where he isn't life. So his question, what are you doing with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers because in recent years you talked me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a-favorite now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule the 7, gross to $12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to $24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this tax bear, this single mail is doing this. Right. He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednauseum, called a Backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single mail is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if you wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in 6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth. There is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the Backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS Chief Council signed off on this about two or three years ago in a conference before then. There was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation. And the top attorney of the IRS comes out and says, this is cool. That's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, to the other that, oh sorry, go ahead back. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self. Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going to be go by possibly. Yep. Yep. This was part of the House Wains and Means proposal committee budget that came out in September. And yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political so popper going on with budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools for a 1K Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told that owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this so holds true? If so is real estate investing still viable option these days with loaded home prices. And then they go and give us the context of there. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. These these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time. Like those are the pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for rental property and your property manager now. And especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is they're not huge pools of capital coming in here. That weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. Like I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners write. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on, broadly in the market, but the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with, that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say 10 years or more. We all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000 right and he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was 100x. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The quality had to be replaced taxes are our, Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist. And if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? I owe them a first month rent that that choose into my net operating profit the year and year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again, eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their, their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers not picking up the phone, and there's water pouring out all over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car, at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost and less about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah, all right. One more bonus question for you guys, and I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They haven't been communicated with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in. That's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car is getting too much gaspin. So yeah, so in May, they told us. We're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees and bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. We'll go buy. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life more accurately. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house. Said they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look gorgeous. Beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 with the trees here. No. The kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feed? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price? There's a cap ratio on the trees based on the number of leaves. I think I do I just suck it up here. These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. I would go straight biblical. You go I for two. You take his. That's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You go fix people's toilets in middle the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I'm not going to do it. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000. It's a depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. I think I got a steel. Then you can sell them as lumber. That's going to save them. The solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me new lead isn't. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday, and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week. Thank you.\\n What particular sectors/names do you find most compelling for a young investor with a 35 40 year time horizon? A one-time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunks over the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice. Or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year, the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the market's work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the market. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it, as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital and time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Cussmer's Yats. It's one of the best title books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book I've ever read. It has written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage. I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl, what it is like to be a wife and a mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by the words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they used to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person. And I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this sort of psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogging a life from runs of marathon. You have to sort of ease into it and train and get better. And so the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. Right? So I think you can start by asking some questions like to this person, how do you plan? Retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year. Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Simple wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in the stock market. Now if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to nickmory.com. That's MUR-A-Y. Because Nick sells these books himself.

I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday, and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week. Thank you.\\n How does the fed raising interest rates fights off inflation? We just want to help people make better decisions with their finances and just think through all the things that come to play when making these decisions. So that's what the show is going to be. Each week I'm going to be here. If you have a question for us, email us, ask the compound show at gmail.com. Now real quick on some of the format of the show before we get started here, we get a wider range of questions. Everything from personal finance to taxes to investing to stockpicking to crypto, to saving retirement. Everything in between. And I have been writing a blog for going on 10 years now. I've been doing our podcast animal spirits for four or five years. I have a CFA, I have an MBA. I'm not trying to brag here. Just link it out there, my resume. But I don't pretend to be an expert in every single financial concept out there. So each week I'm also going to bring an expert on the show with me to answer some questions where I'm not an expert on the topic and they have some expert domain knowledge on the topic that I don't. So without further ado, that's how it's going to work. Duncan, let's do the first question. Cool. Hey everyone, we received a matchaver. Thanks for tuning in today. Like Ben said, this was kind of like a secret. We didn't promote it. It's cool to see so many of you already are already showing up there. So first up, the question is, I recently had a friend tell me that his retirement account had gained 2% in the previous year. He has his money with a family friend that has taken an ultra conservative approach and is nearly 100% fixed income. He's in his mid 30s and these are his retirement funds. I told him that he should have the majority of his stocks, his money and stocks with this kind of time horizon. I'm not an advisor, so I want to be careful about advice. But what's the best way for him to do this? A one-time move to stocks or index funds, move his money and chunks over the course of the next year. Any advice would be appreciated. This is an interesting one because so many people today are worried about others taking too much advice. Or too much risk, I should say. So it's kind of interesting to think through why would this person be so conservative? Because last year, the stock market was up almost 20%. Crypto was up an ungodly amount. Even bonds were up. So 2% is pretty tough to stomach. So there's reasons people don't take a lot of risk. One could be they just don't understand how the market's work. Maybe they're too scared. Maybe they're getting bad advice from their advisor here. Maybe they're just scared of losing money in the market. So they've already lost money in their scarred from the past. The way that I look at it, as a young person with decades and decades ahead of them, it's virtually impossible to take too much risk in your portfolio because your two biggest assets are human capital and time. So you have this power of compounding and your future earnings power as this huge tailwind. The problem is there's a huge difference between the right advice and advice that actually works. So if this person is scared of losing money, which it can happen, I wanted to read something from one of my favorite books. It's called Where the Cussmer's Yats. It's one of the best title books of all time, as well as probably the funniest investment book I've ever read. It has written in 1940. Now that's a pretty short list of funny investment books, but I just wanted to read this one passage. I think it really ties into this question. Like all of life's rich emotional experiences, the full flavor of losing important money cannot be conveyed by literature. Art cannot convey an inexperienced girl, what it is like to be a wife and a mother. There are certain things that cannot be adequately explained to a virgin by the words or pictures. Nor can any description that I might offer here even approximate what it might feel like to lose a real chunk of money they used to own. It's tough because finance is way more about emotions than spreadsheets. So you could try to educate this person. And I think that can help, but since no one teaches this stuff, it's probably better to ease into it and look at this sort of psychological framework. So no one gets off the couch on day one who's never jogging a life from runs of marathon. You have to sort of ease into it and train and get better. And so the way I view it is the good strategy you can stick with is vastly superior to the great strategy that you can't stick with. Right? So I think you can start by asking some questions like to this person, how do you plan? Retiring if your portfolio is going to trail inflation every year. Does your current advisor actually understand your time horizon and risk profile? And do you understand how the stock market works? And if this person doesn't, there's no shame in that. I think there is a great way to learn in one of my favorite books in this topic. Simple wealth and inevitable wealth by Nick Murray is a classic one of the best books I've ever read on getting a long term mindset and thinking through investing in the stock market. Now if you want to buy this book for your friend, you can actually get it on Amazon. You have to go to nickmory.com. That's MUR-A-Y. Because Nick sells these books himself. He printed it on his own and Nick is a, not a businessman. He's a business common man. So that's a great book to check out to teach someone like this. What do we think Duncan? Yeah, no, it sounds good. I've got to read that one. I've ever read that one yet. It sounds like what your time has all about the very idea of risk tolerance, right? Just figuring out what someone's willing to put. Sure, it's your, it's how much risk you need to take how much you want to take and how much you can actually accept. And that's a tough balance to strike, but obviously this person would decad to head of them. Need to take a little bit more risk. All right, a question to what do we got? Okay, so for this question, we have, I'm a 48 year old single male with around $840,000 saved. That is 55% traditional IRA, 35% Roth and 10% taxable. I'm currently maxing out my Roth 401k Roth IRA and putting a few thousand into my taxable account every year. Next year will be the first year. I will make significantly more than the Roth IRA income limit of $120,000. What do I do with the $6,000 Roth IRA contribution going forward? And then they go, they go through a little more detail. That will get. Okay. First of all, good problem to have this person's income is rising. They're saving a lot. So kudos to you. I would love to be able to talk about Roth IRAs with you, but I actually have an expert here. My personal tax consultant, our CFO at Realty Ritold's wife, man, event Bill Sweet, who I believe has Roth IRA tattooed on his back like Ben Affleck has with the dragon. So we're going to bring Bill into kind of help us here with this one on the tax side. Roth King. Gentlemen, it's true. guilty as charged. So I want to start single mail is in the game. Ben, you're absolutely right. My man has almost a quarter more than a quarter million dollars saved up and that's fantastic given where he isn't life. So his question, what are you doing with the $6,000? He's hit the Roth IRA direct contribution limit. To answer this, Ben, let me ask you a question. Let's fast forward 10 years. Let's say that I could just gift you $10,000 in one of three accounts. One is in a traditional IRA subject to income tax on distribution. The second is in a brokerage account, non-qualified. So you got to pay capital gains. And then let's say I give you $10,000 in a Roth IRA. Which one do you choose and why? Well, I'm cheating here because I already have the answers because in recent years you talked me into switching my 401k from a traditional to a Roth. So I'm going to take the Roth without having a phone a friend. Right. And the idea there is that do yourself a future self-a-favorite now, which is if you can get all that gain, the $6,000, let's say rule the 7, gross to $12,000 in 10 years, and then gross to $24,000 God willing in 20 years, et cetera. If you can get all that gain tax free, why wouldn't you do that? And this tax bear, this single mail is doing this. Right. He's max funding a Roth 401k. So let me skip forward to the solution. At $140,000 of AGI, you're no longer allowed to directly contribute to a Roth IRA. But you can do this really, really filthy solution that we've discussed in the past Ednauseum, called a Backdoor Roth IRA. The mechanics with that are that you fund a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA. And then in your tax return, you do not elect to take a tax deduction. This taxpayer, single mail is above the income limit. He couldn't take a tax deduction if you wanted to. So every year that he does that, he can dump the money in 6,000 in traditional IRA. That's his contribution limit. Immediately then, convert that asset to a Roth. There is no income limit on Roth IRA conversions. That's the Backdoor Roth IRA process. The IRS Chief Council signed off on this about two or three years ago in a conference before then. There was some ambiguity on whether this was totally allowed. But if there's nothing in the law that prohibits it, there's no IRS regulation. And the top attorney of the IRS comes out and says, this is cool. That's a strategy that we can all deploy. No, to the other that, oh sorry, go ahead back. So the whole point here is that you're just figuring out a way to pay some taxes now to defer them for later and have the compounding grow tax free. That's the idea. If you're going to save the money anyway, why not look to sort of help your future self. Back to that question we brought in for. So just two other quick points I want to make on this topic. Number one is that Congress is making noise about shutting this contribution. And so this might be over, unfortunately, beginning January 1st, 2022. And that door is going to be going to be go by possibly. Yep. Yep. This was part of the House Wains and Means proposal committee budget that came out in September. And yeah, this is targeted. We'll see if it survives the committee stuff. This is a hot potato right now. Pull up the Wall Street Journal if you want to get the latest and greatest and the political so popper going on with budget reconciliation. But yes, this could be something that goes away next year. Okay. All right. Duncan, what's the next one? Okay. So next up we have a real estate one. Once someone has maxed out their investing tools for a 1K Roth IRA is real estate the next best option. I've always been told that owning property is the best wealth building tool outside of investing. Do you guys believe this so holds true? If so is real estate investing still viable option these days with loaded home prices. And then they go and give us the context of there. I understand why people would think this. You're told from a young age that real estate is the best investment you can make. These these big dollar amounts happening in real estate. And also real estate, especially now when people are worried about hedging against inflation. That's a great hedge because you can lock in a long term low interest rate. And if you're doing rental properties, you can potentially increase the income every other time. Like those are the pros. The cons of course are the water heater breaks down on the weekend for rental property and your property manager now. And especially if you're planning on doing this out of the city or out of state. That's tough. So do you really want to be someone who's running a rental operation? And the other thing is they're not huge pools of capital coming in here. That weren't there before that can do this much more efficiently than individuals. So I know that there are individuals who can do this. I would just caution people to understand that this is true active investing active in the form of you have to do a lot of stuff. There's a lot of costs involved. And it's probably not going to be easy. And one blown something in the house and you're spending on it and you lose all your income for the whole year. Yeah, you're running a business. That's it. I agree. So not only do we as a firm advice folks on some of these decisions, but I also play this game. Like I'm a client too. I own a five unit rental property in suburban New York. And there are really two big things I want to say on this. Number one is that I think the listeners write. I think over the long term real estate is an awesome long term investing opportunity. But like everything in investing, it's less about what you buy and it's probably more about what you pay. And so the listeners thinking about this, I think soberly, Ben, I think correctly identifies the what's going on, broadly in the market, but the reality is real estate is local. And so if you can find a local opportunity, if you can find somebody that you have a relationship with, that potentially wants to help you out, that's a great thing to jump in on. If you're focused on, let's say 10 years or more. We all know the guy who's dad bought a house in Brooklyn in 1975 for $5,000 right and he sold it last year for a half million. Therefore his return was 100x. No, it wasn't. Along the way, Ben, you're right. He had to replace a roof at some point for $20,000. The quality had to be replaced taxes are our, Well, put in your situation. How do you find tenants every year? So it's rough. And that means for me putting it out on Craigslist. And if that doesn't work, I need to go find a broker, right? I owe them a first month rent that that choose into my net operating profit the year and year one, meaning every tenant I sign a new tenant is a net loss for that first year, right? And Ben, I'm glad you brought that up because it's work. Real estate investing is work unless you're outsourcing this stuff, which again, eats in your profit. I have five tenants. That means I have five clients that I need to sit down with at least once a year to discuss their, their lease. There are broken toilets that happen at two in the morning on a random Tuesday. And if my plumbers not picking up the phone, and there's water pouring out all over my floor, it's up to me to get off my butt, get in my car, at two in the morning and drive out there and get that fixed. So my advice is be prepared to run a business. This is a part-time job. Pay attention to cost and less about other variables like if everyone else is doing it. And you really have to be in this for the long haul. Yeah, all right. One more bonus question for you guys, and I'm going through personally. This is not coming from a listener. This is not coming from you. This is me. I've had some issues with my landscape recently. They're having, I feel for them because they're having a labor shortage. They haven't been communicated with me very well. So we needed to replace some trees in the backyard because they kept dying. Every single summer, these trees die and every summer they tell us a new type of tree that's going to go in. That's going to fix this problem. Surprisingly, they said the trees are getting too much water. I don't know if that's like kind of like your car mechanic making up a part and telling you about, but sure, too much water. Your car is getting too much gaspin. So yeah, so in May, they told us. We're going to replace these trees where we got some nice birch trees and bring back. It's going to be beautiful. We'll give you an estimate. We'll put them in. We'll go buy. We don't hear anything. I reach out a few times and they didn't get back to me. So I said, you know what? Fine. And guess what? The trees that were back there came back to life more accurately. We had a lot of rain this summer. Fast forward to September. I see some tracks going into the back of the house. Looks like someone had driven on the back of the house. Said they get home from work. Asked my wife what's going on. She said, I don't know. I was gone all day. We go back in the backyard. The new trees are there. Look gorgeous. Beautiful. They never told us. They sent me the bill. We're talking close to $2,000 with the trees here. No. The kids have already gone out and named each tree. They like their own tree. What sort of recourse do I have here? Do I complain? Do I suck it up? Do I ask for some sort of long-term guarantee on these trees? What do I do? Do I pay it in full and just stop my feed? I'd ask how they value the trees. How they get up at that price? There's a cap ratio on the trees based on the number of leaves. I think I do I just suck it up here. These are Ben Carlson problems. Do you know how I solved this problem? Do you know where this guy lives? Do you know where his business address is? I know it's located. I would go straight biblical. You go I for two. You take his. That's how we do it around here. That's Ben Carlson's. That sounds great until I don't know how to use power tools because I'm useless. You go fix people's toilets in middle the night. I would be on the ground and looking at it and I'm not going to do it. I'm not sure it's worth my negative $4,000. It's a depreciation every year. Those trees are going to grow over time though. This is a great lesson in compounding. They're going to get bigger. I think I got a steel. Then you can sell them as lumber. That's going to save them. The solution is staring us right in the face, guys. All right. Thank you to Bill and Duncan for helping out today. If you have any thoughts about the questions we asked here today, feel free to leave them in the comments below. I go through and read everyone. Even from the haters who call me new lead isn't. I swear. I personally read everyone. If you have a question for the show, ask the compound show at gmail.com. We're going to be going over these every week, every Thursday, and who knows we'll come next week with me for an expert. And we'll see you next week. Thank you.\""
